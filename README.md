# Memory Game
_Memory Card Game using only with HTML / CSS / Javascript_

It´s very easy to cheat the game analysing the rendered code in Browser´s dev tools. That´s not the point.
My objective here is just create a simple game using only HTML, CSS and Javascript resources. Addictionally, I am using Bootstrap (for grid system) and AdminLTE (for color scheme) and some SoundFX :wink:

Just for Fun, no _Industrial Secrets_ here!
